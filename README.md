# Metal concert booking page

This project is about using ready web design by [Cindy Shin](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) and create very own web application by personalizing it.
The original page was about the conference. The contents and backgrounds were changed, added a few images.
Consequently, the concept of the pages transformed into a ticket booking page for metal concerts.
